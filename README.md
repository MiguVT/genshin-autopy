# Genshin-AutoPy

**‚ö† Warning:** This project is still in development and does not yet have a stable release.

## üåü Introduction
Genshin-AutoPy is inspired by the amazing project [hoyolab-auto](https://github.com/torikushiii/hoyolab-auto), but instead of using Node.js, it is built with Python. This design ensures compatibility with low-resource operating systems and caters to users who prioritize a highly optimized setup.

The project uses Python alongside `cron` (or Task Scheduler on Windows) to execute scripts only when necessary, avoiding unnecessary resource consumption. Additionally, all dependencies and configurations are managed within a virtual environment, making it simple to uninstall and keep your system clean.

While Linux is the primary target for Genshin-AutoPy, full compatibility with Windows is also provided for a broader range of users.

## üöÄ Features
- **Auto Code Redeem**: Automatically redeems Genshin Impact promotional codes.
- **Auto Daily and Weekly Check-in**: Automates Hoyolab's daily and weekly check-ins for Genshin Impact.

## üñ• Compatibility
- **Linux**: The primary and optimized platform for this project.
- **Windows**: Fully supported for convenience and flexibility.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher (recommended 3.12+ for optimal performance and modern features)
  - Both **32-bit** and **64-bit systems** support Python 3.12+ as long as the operating system supports it.
  - For the most optimized experience, Python 3.12 or newer is strongly recommended.
- Pip (Python's package manager)
- Cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) for task scheduling

*Don't worry about prerequisites, my scripts will manage all of that. Just run-and-use!*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
> üöß **Work in Progress**: The installation guide is being finalized and will be available soon.
